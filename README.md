# MinimizingFunctionWithPSOBasic
With this code, you can minimize a function and observe the changes in iterations with graphic outputs.

## History of Particle Swarm Optimization
It was developed by Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Eberhart in 1995 as a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. PSO is an algorithm developed because it is observed that the movements of animals living in a herd while meeting their basic needs, affect other individuals in the herd and that the herd achieves its goal more easily.
